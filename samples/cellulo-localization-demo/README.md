cellulo-control-panel
=====================

This is a debug tool to view the robot's pose on an A4 paper whose top left
corner is the (0,0) coordinate. It supports desktop and Android and was tested
with Qt 5.4.1, Ubuntu 14.04, Android SDK 17 and Android NDK r10e. It needs
[qml-cellulo](../../) to be installed. It is intended to be loaded into Qt
Creator, built and deployed from there.
